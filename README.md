# E-Commerce Website (MERN Stack)

This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It includes all the essential features of a modern online shopping platform, such as user authentication, product listings, cart management, payment processing, and order tracking. The application has been designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with a responsive UI and an efficient backend to manage data and transactions.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and profile management using JWT.
- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for product listings, with image uploads and category management.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add and remove products, adjust quantities, and view the total price.
- **Payment Integration**: Checkout process integrated with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- **Order Tracking**: Users can view their order history and track the status of their current orders.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage products, orders, and users.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first responsive design to ensure compatibility across all devices.
- **Search & Filters**: Users can search for products by name and use filters such as category and price range.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js with Context API or Redux for state management, styled with CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, RESTful APIs for handling server-side logic and database operations.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing product, user, and order data.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for secure user authentication.
- **Payment Gateway**: Integration with Stripe or PayPal for handling transactions.
- **Deployment**: Application deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS, with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## How to Run Locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   cd ecommerce
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder with necessary environment variables (e.g., database URL, JWT secret, payment gateway keys).
4. Run the development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
